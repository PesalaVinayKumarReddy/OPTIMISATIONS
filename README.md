Synthetic data
---
   I prepared a Self Potential Synthetic data of inclined sheet and horizontal Cylinder and put them in a matrix 'santa'.
x is a point on principle profile 
santa is a data set of 14851 examples with profile data in columns from 1st row to 69th row and giving a binary classification in the 70th row
binary classification('1' for inclined sheet profile data and '0' for horizontal cylinder profile data)
k is multiplicative factor decides maximum ampllitude 
z0 is the depth of the body
alpha is the angle of polarisation
a is width of the sheet
different types of sheets and cylinder data is produced and classified
