SP Synthetic data (syntheticdata.py)
---
   I prepared a Self Potential Synthetic data of inclined sheet and horizontal Cylinder and put them in a matrix 'santa'.
'x' is a point on principle profile. 
'santa' is a data sets of 14851 examples in rows with profile data in columns from 1st row to 69th row and giving a binary classification ('1' for inclined sheet profile data and '0' for horizontal cylinder profile data) in the 70th row.
'k' is multiplicative factor decides maximum amplitude. 
'z0' is the depth of the body.
'alpha' is the angle of polarisation.
'a' is width of the sheet.
Thus different types of inclined sheets and horizontal cylinder data are produced and classified.
